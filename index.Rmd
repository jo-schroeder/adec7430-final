In March of 2025 the Academy updated their voting guidelines for the Annual Academy Awards. Now, voters must have watched each film nominated in a category in order to be eligible to vote for the winner. [^1] If you're wondering how that wasn't a rule already, you're not alone! [^2] 

Ever year the legitimacy of the Oscars are questioned, yet they remain one of the most important awards in the film industry. [^3] In this project, we aim to answer two questions about Hollywood's most prestigious awards.

- Does the phenomenon of an "Oscar Campaign" really exist? 
- How well does Oscar buzz alone predict who is nominated for Academy Awards?

Other projects attempt to predict Oscar winners using big datasets, including information on accolades garnered throughout a given award season. [^4] However, to our knowledge there hasn't been an attempt to predict nominations using Oscar buzz in over 10 years. [^5]

## What is an Oscar Campaign anyway?

![Was Timothée Chalamet on a 2025 Oscar Campaign?](./img/000043-edit.jpg)
If you were on the internet in January of 2025, you may have heard speculations that Timothée Chalamet was on an Oscar Campaign. Folks online speculated that Timothée was generating buzz for his performance as Bob Dylan *A Complete Unknown* with the goal of getting the nod and taking home that golden statue. [^5] For Acting categories, actors are nominated based on the accumulation of votes from members of the Academy's Acting branch. [^6] So, it stands to reason that being in the zietgiest would be of interest to award season hopefuls.

```{r eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
trends[,c("Month", "Amber Heard", "Johnny Depp")] %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Amber Heard", "Johnny Depp")) %>%
  mutate(Month = ym(Month), 
         value = ifelse(value == "<1", 0, value)) %>%
  #filter(year(Month) >= 2020) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = as.numeric(value), group = name)) +
  geom_line(
    color = "black",
    size = 1,
  ) +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Google Trend Search Interest") +
  labs(title = "Scandal Drives Search Interest",
       subtitle = "Monthly search interest for the terms 'Amber Heard' and 'Johnny Depp' \nsince 2004") +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "5 years", date_labels = "%Y") +
  facet_wrap(vars(name)) 
```

## How would we quantify buzz?

Film aggregation websites like Internet Movie Database (IMBD) and The Movie Database (TMDB) often include user generated popularity scores for films and actors derived from votes. [Q Scores](https://www.qscores.com/) have been used for decades in fields like marketing to understand the consumer appeal of entities including actors. The drawback of popularity metrics like these is that they may not capture longitudinal change over time at all or at a scale fine-grained enough to be robust predictors of nomination. We propose using Google Trends Search Interest in as given year as a proxy for Oscar buzz. In addition to the Google Trends, we gather a dataset of popular actors and films and several covariates, as well as historic Academy Award nominees.

## Data Acquisition

We started by downloading a a dataset of Academy Award winners from Kaggle. Then we subset to Acting awards (Best Lead Actor, Best Lead Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress) and data for which Google Trends are available (2004 - present). 

Next, we used the TMDB API to extract the top five billed cast members for the 25 most commercially successful movies for each year from 2004-present. Commercial successful was defined by revenue generated. 

From these two sources, we netted a list of 668 actors. We then downloaded the monthly Google Trend Search Interest for each actor since 2004. The process of doing this via API was throttled, so this information was downloaded manually. Google Trend Search Interest ranges from 0-100, and is relative to the peak popularity of the given the actor themselves. In other words, Google Trends cannot be used to make absolute comparisons for actors in our dataset, but we can compare the shape and features of the trends as time series.
